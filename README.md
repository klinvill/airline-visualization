![travis-ci build status] (https://travis-ci.org/klinvill/airline-visualization.svg?branch=refactored-split_files)

Visualization of and blog post about finding which airlines fly out of which airports most frequently. 

This visualization was originally built to satisfy a class assignment for a [CSCI 183 Data Science] (http://klinvill.github.io/CSCI-183-Data-Science/) course I took. It has since been moved into it's own repository. I'm currently working on refactoring the code, adding in more tests, adding a build system, automating the data ingest process, and integrating the project with a continuous integration framework.
