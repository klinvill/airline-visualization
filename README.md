# airline-visualization 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/klinvill/airline-visualization.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/klinvill/airline-visualization)

Visualization of and blog post about finding which airlines fly out of which airports most frequently. 

This visualization was originally built to satisfy a class assignment for a [CSCI 183 Data Science] (https://github.com/klinvill/CSCI-183-Data-Science/) course I took. It has since been moved into it's own repository. I'm currently working on refactoring the code, adding in more tests, adding a build system, automating the data ingest process, and integrating the project with a continuous integration framework. You can see the blog post in action [here] (https://klinvill.github.io/airline-visualization/html/blog.html)
