# airline-visualization

Visualization of and blog post about finding which airlines fly out of which airports most frequently. This visualization was originally built to satisfy a class assignment for a [CSCI 183 Data Science] (http://klinvill.github.io/CSCI-183-Data-Science/) course I took. This visualization has been moved into it's own repository.
